# Constructor-Hangman

Clone this repo to play a generic Hangman Game in Node.JS

This game was created through node.js using npm inquirer; an inquirer.prompt was used in order to get the user input
and a switch case statement was used to check the user input. Very simple and generic. Hope you enjoy!
